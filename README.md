## Introduction

libqmsstyles is a Qt C++ library tailor-made specifically for Windows Vista+ msstyles parsing (soon Windows XP). It is extremely unfinished and some stuff may not work as expected or function names might change in the near future.

This library is being developed under Qt Creator, with Qt 6.10.0.

## Credits

- [msstyleEditor](https://github.com/nptr/msstyleEditor/): original code that helped out **a lot** with Vista+ msstyles parsing

## Installation

This library depends on [LibWres](https://github.com/The-Evil-Ass-Fountain-Openers/LibWres), so make sure to install it before installing LibQmsstyles.

1. Clone this repository with ``git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/The-Evil-Ass-Fountain-Openers/libqmsstyles.git``, or by downloading the source code directly from the ``Code`` button.
2. Within the repository folder, run ``sh install.sh`` in a terminal. You can also pass ``--ninja`` as an argument to compile with Ninja instead.
