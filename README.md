## Introduction

libqmsstyle is a Qt C++ library tailor-made specifically for Windows Vista+ msstyles parsing (soon Windows XP). It is extremely unfinished and some stuff may not work as expected or function names might change in the near future.

At the time of writing this, libqmsstyle is being developed under Qt Creator, with Qt 6.10.0.

This library has [LibWres](https://github.com/The-Evil-Ass-Fountain-Openers/LibWres) as a dependency.

## Credits
